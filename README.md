Spaceship Titanic - Predicting Dimensional Transport

The Spaceship Titanic competition challenges you to predict whether a passenger was *transported to an alternate dimension* during the shipâ€™s collision with a spacetime anomaly. Using detailed personal and transactional records, this project applies the *CRISP-DM* methodology to build a robust machine learning solution.
